### Rename the folder
You'll see the 'rename-student_name' folder in the tree on the left.
Rename the folder as your firstName_lastName

### How do I submit this when I'm done?
Before you're done, generate a Git log file, which will show your commits by running this command:
git log --date=local --pretty=format:"%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s" > commits.local.tsv.txt 

Move the 'complete' slider to show you're done when you're ready to finish.
